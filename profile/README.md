# TV Labs

TV Labs builds tools that solve real problems in Smart TV app development and testing. Our cloud platform gives you remote access to actual devices, eliminating hardware procurement headaches while supporting vision and appium-baseed test automation. We're focused on practical solutions that reduce the frustration of cross-platform TV app development.

### OSS Projects

* [Lua](https://github.com/tv-labs/lua) - run Lua code directly on the BEAM, with powerful DSLs for extending Lua APIs, directly in Elixir

* [TV Labs WebdriverIO Service](https://github.com/tv-labs/wdio-tvlabs-service) - optimizes Appium to run on the TV Labs platform
